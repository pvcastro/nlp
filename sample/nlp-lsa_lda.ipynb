    "Before the state-of-the-art word embedding technique, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) area good approaches to deal with NLP problems. Both LSA and LDA have same input which is Bag of words in matrix format. LSA focus on reducing matrix dimension while LDA solves topic modeling problems.\n",

    "I will not go through mathematical detail and as there is lot of great material for that. You may check it from reference. For the sake of keeping it easy to understand, I did not do pre-processing such as stopwords removal. It is critical part when you use LSA, LSI and LDA. After reading this article, you will know:\n",
